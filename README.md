# seaside-set-manager
A set managing application for Project+, complete with customizable stagelists! In the future I plan to integrate this with the Challonge API.

# How to Use
1a. Open Stagelist.txt and modify with your own starters and counterpicks.
1b. You must have at least 2 Starters and 1 Counterpick (because that way there are actually stages to ban and whatnot).
2. Open set-manager.exe and change the settings to your liking (Player names and set type)
3. Press Start when ready.
4. The program will automatically randomize RPS and prompt players to ban.
5. Select stages according to the header until a stage is decided, at which point a menu will pop up at the bottom asking you to report who won each game.
6. The program will automatically detect when someone has won a set depending on the set type and how many games the player has won.
Enjoy!
